## Set up

Start by installing and opening the [Silhouette Studio software](https://www.silhouettefr.fr/applications-logiciels/).
Then drag and drop the png you want to cut on the cutting area.

You need to use a png with a transparent background so the software will create the cut between the transparent and full parts of the image.

You can check that the red line representing the cut is well placed and complete, check the size of your cutting, and leave a small space between the cut and the edge of the cutting area.

when all of your images to cut are placed of the area in the software, you can plug in, open and turn on the Cameo.

## Sending the cutting pattern

Go from the `DESIGN` mode to the `SEND` ("ENVOYER") mode at the top right corner in the software, then plug in the Cameo in USB to the computer.

Check that the Cameo is available at the bottom right in the `SEND` mode.

Take the plastic cutting sheet and take off the blue paper from the sticky surface.

Place your vinyl/paper/whatever all nice and flat on the sticky surface.

Make sure the whole surface is covered, or at least the area where you have patterns to be cut.

In the `SEND` mode, select the type of material you want to cut, then click on the `SEND` ("ENVOYER") button.

**Materials informations :**
- Vinyl, Mat = the basic vinyls, in rolls or in sheets, no need to modify the cutting numbers.
- Metallic sticker sheet : copper sheets, to make sure you don't cut through the cardboard support of the cooper sheet it is better to lower the strength of the blade to 18.

## Finishing the sticker

Once the cutting is done, after the blade go back to the top left corner of the Cameo, you can press the down arrow button ðŸ”½ to disengage the cutting sheet.

Slowly peel off the vinyl/whatever sheet from the cutting sheet, and neatly place back the blue paper on the cutting sheet.

With scissors, cut around your pattern, and take off the vinyl/whatev around your sticker.

If needed (if your sticker is in multiple pieces, very intricate, or letters for example), put painter's tape or transfert sticker on the cut pattern, to hold everything together, before sticking it.

Take off the support sheet underneath the vinyl, stick your sticker wherever, rub it to avoid bubble, then take off the tape/transfert sticker.
